This code is for how to randomly select cells to equate to the coverage of privately protected areas. 

It will then calcualte the total areas of each biome in these cells. 

This figures can then be used to determine coverage of randomly placed privately protected areas against the current distribution. 

This code can be used with any underlaying spatial layer - e.g. Global human footprint of KEy Biodiversity Areas.
